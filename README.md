# LeetCodeQuestions

This project contains the Implementation of some leetCode Questions I did.
I have used multiple references across the web for these implementations while studying algorithms and data structures.

Each LeetCode question is contained on it's on class, every class has a static method Solve() that takes care of mocking the imputs and printing the outputs.
The Solve() method calls the actual method that you are required to implement on the LeetCode questions with the same method signature.
Each class has it's own documentation with the promp you get in LeetCode with constraints and examples.
